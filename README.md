Employee attrition is generally low; however, some risks are discovered among:
Younger employees (23–35)
Entry-level staff
Employees without recent promotions
Departments such as R&D

(1) Overall Attrition Rate
The overall attrition rate is relatively low compared to the total number of employees.

(2)Age with Attrition
Most employees are between 23 and 43 years old; besides, 23-35 age range has the highest attrition rate, which indicates younger employees are more likely to leave rather than older employees.

(3)Job Level and Attrition
Employees had an average tenure of around 7 years with the company. In terms of attrition rate, many employees who work at the entry-level and have 0, 1, or 2 years of relationship with the company leave the most.

(4)Income and Attrition
Average income and income rate are not significantly lower compared to the highest income levels. Income does not appear to be the primary consideration of attrition.

(5) Department Analysis
Research and development has the highest number of employees leaving compared to other departments.

(7) Work-life Balance and Satisfaction
Most employees report good job satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and work-life balance. Therefore, these factors can not be a key driver of attrition.

(8) Years Since Last Promotion
Employees who have not received promotions describe higher attrition, but many of these employees are entry-level staff.

This analysis suggests that the company needs career growth and career engagement strategies to reduce attrition because they have the highest involvement in the job, and their satisfaction rates are also good, and they earn sufficient income.
